My rock, paper, scissors game was just a test of my comprehension of JavaScript. I recently learned it and wanted to see what I could create with it. A rock, paper, scissors game was the first thing that game to mind so that is exactly what I did. This game is currently not 100% finished. There are some features I would like to add and fix some glitches.
